//! The wheel over the transport scrubber: scroll deltas in, skips out.
//!
//! **A wheel skips, it doesn't seek.** The playhead moves through
//! `Command::Skip` — the arrow keys' own command — and so through core's
//! [`SkipCoordinator`](pundit_core::skip::SkipCoordinator), because a
//! flick of the wheel is a burst exactly like a held arrow key and the
//! coordinator's debounce and anchoring are what stop a burst walking
//! backwards. It is also what lets the wheel work mid-take, where the
//! scrubber's own drag is refused.
//!
//! **Notches, not pixels.** A mouse reports one [`NOTCH`] at a time; a
//! trackpad reports a stream of a few pixels each. Skipping by a fraction of a
//! notch would hand the coordinator dozens of commands per flick — and, while
//! recording, log every one of them in the commentary. So the deltas are added
//! up here and a skip leaves only on a whole notch.
//!
//! **Direction is a media player's, not a document's** (the coach, 2026-09-25):
//! rolling the wheel **away** from you goes **forward**, as it does in every
//! video player they use. The other reading — that a positive delta scrolls the
//! content down and so walks a timeline back, which is [`crate::zoom_input`]'s
//! convention — is defensible on paper and was wrong in the hand.
