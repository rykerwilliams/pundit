//! The match setup sheet's colour picker: the kit colours its first row
//! offers, and the maths between a `#rrggbb` string and the hue, saturation
//! and brightness its strip and area are drawn and read in.
//!
//! **All of it is here rather than in the `.slint`.** What the project stores
//! is the hex string ([`match_panel::hex`] / [`parse_hex`]), so the picker has
//! to land on exactly those bytes: a conversion of Slint's own (`Colors.hsv`)
//! would be a second rounding, and the swatch, the field and the scoreboard
//! could then disagree in the last bit. [`hsv_of_hex`] and [`hex_of_hsv`]
//! round-trip every 8-bit colour, which the tests pin.
