//! Clip preview (Phase 7 spec P5): one clip's composite on screen in place of
//! the game video, built by a [`Preview`] on its own thread.
//!
//! The source player is **paused, not unloaded**, so closing a preview is a
//! re-request of where it already is: the preview fills the same mailbox, and
//! closing empties it and has the player preroll its own frame back into it,
//! so the last composited frame doesn't stay up (nor stay mapped by the UI).
//!
//! The preview's messages arrive as their own input, tagged with the
//! generation that sent them: closing joins the thread, but a message it had
//! already queued is still in the channel, and must not be taken for the next
//! preview's.
