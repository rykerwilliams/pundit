//! The command bus (spec D5): one thread that owns the [`Project`], its folder,
//! and the [`SourcePlayer`]. The UI talks to it only through [`Command`]s and
//! hears back only through [`Event`]s, so everything here runs headless — the
//! harness drives it with a system-memory sink and no Slint.
//!
//! One input channel carries commands, the player's forwarded GStreamer
//! messages, and the recorder's and the exporter's messages, so the thread
//! never has to choose between queues. The loop waits with `recv_timeout` on
//! the earlier of two deadlines (the skip debounce and the recording start
//! timeout); with neither armed it simply blocks.
