//! Transcription (Phase 10 spec S5–S7): the coach's words, one clip at a
//! time, on a queue the bus thread owns.
//!
//! **One job in flight, FIFO behind it, and enqueueing is idempotent** —
//! against the queue *and* against the clip running, which is not in the
//! queue. A clip that is waiting says so: `Queued` is derived from the queue
//! rather than stored anywhere.
//!
//! **Recording always wins** (spec S5). A transcript never refuses a
//! recording: starting one cancels the job in flight and puts its clip back
//! at the **front** of the queue, and [`Bus::run_next_if_idle`] refuses to
//! start while a recording, an export or a preview is going. Nothing here
//! has to remember to resume the queue afterwards: `Bus::run` calls
//! [`Bus::run_next_if_idle`] at the bottom of every turn, so the queue picks
//! up on the first input after the machine is free.
//!
//! **A cancel is never a failure.** The clip goes back to idle, and a job
//! that finished before the cancel reached it keeps its words — the same
//! trade export makes when a cancel loses the race to a written file.
//!
//! **The job may download its model first** (Phase 11 spec S3), when the
//! model is absent and [`whisper`] gave it somewhere to fetch it from. That
//! is its own [`Stage`] on screen, and a download that fails drops the queue
//! behind it: otherwise every waiting clip tries again in turn — each one
//! offline at the field, or each one another 488 MB after a bad hash.
//!
//! The transcriber's messages arrive as their own input, tagged with the
//! generation of the job that sent them and the clip they are about: a
//! cancelled job's `Finished` can still be in the channel when the next one
//! starts, and taking it for the new job's would leave two running at once.
