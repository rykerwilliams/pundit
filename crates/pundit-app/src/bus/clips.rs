//! Clip management (Phase 3 spec C1–C5): field edits, delete to the trash,
//! reorder and sort, jump, and the undo history they share.
//!
//! Every mutation is diffed first (unchanged ⇒ no save, no undo step), then
//! applied, saved, recorded and published: recorded before it's published,
//! so an event always follows any shred the push caused. Every push goes
//! through [`Bus::record`], so a delete the history drops always has its
//! trashed file shredded.
//!
//! **The trash.** A deleted clip's recording moves to
//! `recordings/.trash/<file>` only once the project without it has saved, and
//! comes back before the project with it is saved. So `project.json` never
//! lists a clip whose file is in `.trash`, which every open empties; a crash
//! leaves at worst an unreferenced recording in `recordings/` (BACKLOG #38).
//! Shredding only ever touches `.trash`.
