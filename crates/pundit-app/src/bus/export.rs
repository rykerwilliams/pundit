//! Export (Phase 5 spec X4, Phase 8 specs E1, E5 and E6): a **run** of
//! targets, rendered one at a time by an [`Exporter`] on its own thread while
//! the bus goes on.
//!
//! **One export path.** All clips, one tag's clips, a single clip and the
//! goals reel are all [`ExportTarget`]s, each rendered as a compilation: one
//! plan, one schedule, one progress model, one cancel.
//!
//! **Everything is refused up front, naming the clip** (or, for the reel, the
//! game video's file). A missing game video or commentary recording fails the
//! whole run before a frame is rendered, rather than an hour into one. Media
//! itself only warns about either and degrades to a black inset or to silence,
//! so this check is what makes the loss visible at all.
//!
//! **Progress is frames, and the whole run travels in every event.** The
//! sheet renders the run it is handed, so it can't be left holding a state the
//! bus has moved past, and the remaining frames of the pending targets are
//! there to divide by the rate (spec E5).
//!
//! The exporter's messages arrive as their own input. It sends exactly one
//! `Finished`, last, and there is one exporter at a time on a FIFO channel,
//! so no message can be stale: the thread's own result decides the outcome,
//! and a cancel that loses the race to a finished file reports it done.
//!
//! Recording and export never overlap (a user decision): the recording guard
//! drops [`Command::Export`](super::Command::Export), and `can_record`
//! refuses to record while a run is going.
