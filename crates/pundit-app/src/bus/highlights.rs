//! Player highlights (match vision spec H): the four commands, each one undo
//! step.
//!
//! **A key's position is the caller's**, like every logged position: the
//! stream time of the frame on screen when the coach let go of the drag. The
//! bus asking the player where it is would put the box on whatever frame the
//! queue delay had reached, and a ring a frame off the player it rings is
//! wrong in the preview and in every export.
//!
//! Each command is one `EditHighlights` step holding the **whole** list, as a
//! match-event edit is: the list is small, a snapshot needs no per-command
//! inverse, and a source move or removal purges it from both stacks because a
//! snapshot holds source indices.
