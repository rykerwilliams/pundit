//! Match events and the scoreboard's setup (Phase 9 spec S5).
//!
//! A tag carries the position the readout already had, captured by the caller
//! at the keypress like every other logged command: the bus never asks the
//! player where it is, since queue delay would put the goal somewhere else.
//!
//! A goal's reel trim (match vision spec R3) is set the same way, from the scan
//! position captured at the click, and lives on the goal's record.
//!
//! The editor's two commands are the exception that proves the rule: they carry
//! **typed** text, not a captured position, so there is nothing for queue delay
//! to stale. They hand that text to `core::match_entry` here rather than
//! trusting events parsed at the UI, so every rule of the grammar — the
//! duration bound, the duplicate window, the start/stop cap — is read once,
//! from core, against the project as it is when the command lands.
//!
//! Each tag, delete or trim is one undo step holding the **whole** event list. The
//! list is a handful of records, and a snapshot needs no per-event inverse —
//! but it does hold source indices, so a source move or removal purges it from
//! both stacks (`clips::purge_history_for_source_change`).
//!
//! **The refusal at the cap lives here, not in core's mutator.** A start/stop
//! past the format's last period gets no role from `interpret`, so it would be
//! a record the scoreboard ignores; the Match panel disables the action there
//! (on core's `Project::start_stops_at_cap`, the one rule) and so does the key,
//! and this refuses out loud if it is reached anyway — as a notice, since a
//! backstop for a disabled control has no business stopping the session with a
//! dialog. macOS's mutator silently did nothing instead, which is worse than a
//! refusal.
