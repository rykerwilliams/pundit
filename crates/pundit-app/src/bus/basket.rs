//! The basket (basket spec E, H, C, O, V): one film whose pieces come from
//! several matches, gathered while the coach works and started when they are
//! done.
//!
//! **A piece is a reference, `(project folder, clip id)`, resolved at Start.**
//! Nothing of a project is copied in: a clip the coach fixes after adding it is
//! exported as it now stands, and a piece whose project has gone is refused by
//! name rather than silently dropped (spec E1).
//!
//! **It lives in its own file, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pundit/basket.json`, and
//! not in `state.json`** — [`AppFiles::read`](super::state) discards that
//! whole document on any parse error and every setter rewrites it, so one
//! basket value a build can't read would take the last project, the pen and the
//! speech model with it (spec H1). The same discipline applies inside this
//! file: the two pickers are **string labels**, and one this build doesn't know
//! reads as the default rather than throwing the pieces away.
//!
//! **One resolver, two callers.** Showing the basket and starting it resolve a
//! piece the same way — the open project from memory, every other from
//! `store::read` ([`Bus::project_for`]) — so the sheet can never show a piece
//! that Start then refuses (spec E3a).
