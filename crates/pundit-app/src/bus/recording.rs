//! Recording (Phase 4 spec R6): the one Active state, from Start to a clip.
//!
//! Active is flagged *starting* until the recorder's first buffer reaches the
//! muxer — the camera's in a camera project, the microphone's in an avatar
//! one. Stopping before then (StopRecording, a recorder error, or the start
//! timeout) aborts: no clip, and the file is deleted. Stopping after it always
//! keeps the clip, even if finalizing didn't go cleanly.
//!
//! The recorder's messages arrive as their own input, tagged here with the
//! generation of the recording that produced them, and never reach the
//! player: its EOS would advance the source and its ERROR reset the player.
