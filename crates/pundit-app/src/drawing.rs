//! The stroke being drawn, and the SVG path a stroke renders as (spec D2,
//! D5). The UI thread owns the pointer and the clock; this module owns the
//! buffer, the thinning rule and the coordinates, so all of it is testable
//! without a window.
//!
//! **Coordinates.** The drawing area *is* the content rect (the letterboxed
//! picture at 1×), so a pointer position is already relative to it. An
//! in-progress stroke is buffered in those logical pixels and normalized once
//! at pen-up, by the rect as it is then — which the window reports as
//! `content-width` / `content-height`.
//!
//! A window resize *mid-stroke* therefore normalizes the earlier points, which
//! were captured against the old rect, against the new one: the stroke comes
//! out slightly skewed. That is a known, accepted gap — the fix means
//! threading the rect through every move, for a case that takes a deliberate
//! resize with the button held down.
//!
//! **Time.** Every method takes `now_ns` from the caller, on `now_ns()`'s
//! clock — the bus contract: a timestamp is captured at the input event, not
//! when something downstream gets round to it.
