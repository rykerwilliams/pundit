//! Spec B1: a job thread sends **exactly one** terminal message, on every
//! path — including the one where its body panics (BACKLOG #64).
//!
//! The bus frees its running slot on that message and on nothing else, and
//! one slot is shared by transcription, analysis and tracking (spec B2), so a
//! job that ended without saying so would stop all three for the session.
//!
//! These tests panic on purpose, so the default hook's `thread 'a-job'
//! panicked at …` line on stderr is part of a passing run — it is how the
//! panic still reaches a developer once the coach has been told in prose.
