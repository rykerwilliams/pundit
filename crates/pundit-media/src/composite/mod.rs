//! The composite graph (spec X2–X4, P1): one clip's frame schedule rendered
//! on the GPU, with an [`export`] tail or a [`preview`] tail over the same
//! decode side, pump and geometry.
//!
//! ```text
//! decode: filesrc ! decodebin3 ! [gl_bin: glupload ! glcolorconvert] ! appsink
//! pump:   per output frame, the last decoded frame at or before its source
//!         time, re-stamped n/30
//! head:   appsrc ! gltransformation ! glvideomixer ! <out_w>x<out_h> 30/1
//! export: ! glcolorconvert ! NV12 ! gldownload ! queue ! <encoder>
//!         ! h264parse ! mp4mux ! filesink <path>.part
//!         plus, per output frame, the mixed [`audio`] block
//!         ! avenc_aac ! aacparse ! that same mp4mux
//! preview:! glcolorconvert ! RGBA GL ! appsink sync=true -> the FrameMailbox
//! ```
//!
//! **One graph everywhere.** Export runs on a surfaceless EGL display of its
//! own (one per process), so it doesn't depend on the UI's. Without a GPU,
//! Mesa's llvmpipe runs the same graph — CI included — so the tests exercise
//! the shipping zoom and letterbox. Without EGL at all it fails loudly; there
//! is no software variant. Preview takes Slint's display and context instead
//! (measured: a private one is ~4x worse at the UI's p95), which is why the
//! GL context is a parameter rather than a rule.
//!
//! **Never block without a bound.** A blocking `appsrc` push never returns
//! after a downstream error, and a long pull waits out its whole timeout after
//! a decode error (both measured). So `appsrc` doesn't block, pulls use short
//! timeouts, and every wait polls the cancel flag and the first error either
//! pipeline posted.
