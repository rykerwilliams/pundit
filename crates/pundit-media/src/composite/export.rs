//! The export tail (spec X2–X4, E2): a compilation read back as NV12, encoded
//! to H.264 and muxed into an MP4, driven by the pump on a thread of its own.
//!
//! ```text
//! pad 0: the pumped source frame through `gltransformation` (zoom), at that
//!        entry's fit rect
//! pad 1: the entry's inset -- its webcam recording, or the project's avatar,
//!        at the PiP rect (the avatar's scaled by the pulse)
//! pad 2: the overlay -- drawings, the text bar and the scoreboard -- at the
//!        output size
//! ```
//!
//! Which of the three lands on top, and why, is
//! [`install_overlay_pad`](super::install_overlay_pad)'s.
//!
//! The sound goes into the same muxer, mixed per output frame by
//! [`Mixer`](super::audio::Mixer) and pushed **at or ahead of** the frames it
//! covers.
//!
//! **Every pad gets a buffer for every frame.** A requested pad that never
//! receives one produced no output at all and backed the base `appsrc` up,
//! with no error (measured), so an entry with the PiP off, or with a recording
//! that can't be read, pushes a 1×1 transparent pixel instead — in GL memory,
//! like the recording's own frames (see [`Texture`]). A cut whose pieces come
//! from several matches alternates fed and filler pads as the ordinary case,
//! so the GL memory is not a nicety: a system-memory filler breaks the
//! `glupload` of the next entry that has a real inset.
//!
//! **Caps may change from the pushing thread; geometry may not.** Every
//! `appsrc` takes a mid-stream caps change and it lands on exactly the right
//! frame, but a pad rect set the same way applied up to [`QUEUED`] frames
//! early, so the last frames of an entry took the next entry's layout
//! (measured). The rects live in the [`Schedule`] instead, keyed to each
//! buffer's PTS in a pad probe.
