//! The avatar image (avatar spec A3, A5): one decoder for it, the pre-scaled,
//! premultiplied, circular pixmap the mixer's inset pad carries, and the pulse
//! that sizes that pad frame by frame.
//!
//! **The inset pad, not the overlay** (spec E1, which carries the
//! measurement): drawing it into the overlay's pixmap costs more per frame than
//! the whole overlay does, because `tiny_skia` has no sprite fast path. So the
//! scaling and the blending happen on the GPU, where every other full-frame
//! pixel operation happens (CLAUDE.md).
//!
//! **One decoder, and one set of drawn pixels.** [`decode_still`] is the whole
//! of the decoding — the pick validates with it, and everything below scales
//! its output — and [`drawn`] is the whole of the drawing: cover-cropped into a
//! square, masked to a circle, premultiplied. The Devices popover's thumbnail
//! and the recording corner take it too, so what the coach is shown is what the
//! export draws, and a file that passes the pick cannot fail in an export.
//!
//! **Straight alpha in, premultiplied out.** GStreamer's `RGBA` is straight
//! alpha; tiny-skia stores premultiplied pixels (`overlay.rs` says exactly
//! this about the layer it draws into). A memcpy would leave a cut-out PNG's
//! soft edges at full colour — a bright halo around every soft pixel — so the
//! copy multiplies each of R, G and B by A.
