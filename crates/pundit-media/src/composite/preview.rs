//! The preview tail (spec P1–P4): the composite on screen, in the same
//! [`FrameMailbox`] the source player fills, paced by the commentary's audio
//! clock.
//!
//! ```text
//! pump:  appsrc name=src -- the source frame, GL memory, PTS n/30
//!        appsrc name=ov  -- its overlay, output-size RGBA, the SAME PTS
//!        appsrc name=pip -- an avatar clip's image, the SAME PTS, at a rect
//!                           the pulse sizes (spec E2); absent otherwise
//! rec:   filesrc ! decodebin3 -- video to the PiP pad (only with a camera
//!                                inset), audio to volume ! autoaudiosink
//! tail:  glvideomixer ! 1280x720 30/1 ! glcolorconvert ! RGBA GL ! appsink
//!                                                                  sync=true
//! ```
//!
//! **Record time is output time.** `playback_segments` emits its durations in
//! the recording's own timeline, so output frame `n` is at `n/30` there too.
//! That is why the recording needs no pump, no re-timestamping and no appsink:
//! it plays natively and the mixer aligns the pads by running time. It is also
//! why the overlay's `record_time` is simply `n/30`.
//!
//! **The bar is export's own** (spec E7). Preview runs the clip's one-entry
//! compilation, so its overlay carries the same text bar the file gets, and
//! the line reads `1 / 1 | <name> | tags` because the target is that one clip.
//! The scoreboard comes off the same per-frame call the export makes. What the
//! coach checks here is what the export shows.
//!
//! **One pump, every appsrc, one PTS.** `glvideomixer` waits indefinitely on
//! every pad, so frame `n`'s overlay — and an avatar's image — goes out with
//! frame `n` or the mixer starves. For the same reason the inset pad is
//! requested **only** when there is something to feed it: the recording's
//! video pad with `shows_camera_pip` **and a video track to show it**
//! ([`camera_inset`]), the avatar's appsrc with `shows_avatar`, and neither
//! otherwise. An unlinked video pad `decodebin3` tolerates without stalling its
//! branch (measured).
//!
//! **The audio sink is the clock** (measured: `GstPulseSinkClock`), so the
//! composite follows the commentary — the track the coach hears. The video
//! appsink syncs to that clock, and its backpressure is the whole of the
//! pump's pacing: there is no sleep loop, and PAUSED stops the pump through
//! that same backpressure (measured), so pausing is a state change and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! **Transport runs through the pipeline, not around it** (spec P3). A seek is
//! one pipeline seek: the recording branch seeks natively, and every pumped
//! appsrc, being `stream-type=seekable`, answers `seek-data` by moving the
//! pump's [`Cursor`]. Everything the owner steers — state, seeks, volume — goes
//! through [`Control`], because the graph itself lives and dies on the pump's
//! thread.
