//! Writing an export's [`FileTags`] into the MP4 header.
//!
//! The words are `pundit_core::metadata`'s; this is only the muxer half.
//! `mp4mux` implements `GstTagSetter`, so a tag list set on it before `PLAYING`
//! is written into `moov/udta` when it lays the header out.
//!
//! **Measured on GStreamer 1.24.2** (`mp4mux` from `gst-plugins-good`), by
//! muxing a file with each tag set and reading it back with
//! `ffprobe -show_format`:
//!
//! | tag | in the file |
//! |---|---|
//! | `title`, `comment`, `keywords`, `encoder` | `moov/udta`, read back by name |
//! | `date` (a `glib::Date`) | `©day`, read back as `date=2026-9-21` |
//! | `description` | the XMP packet's `<dc:description>` only |
//! | `datetime` (a `gst::DateTime`) | **ignored** — `mp4mux` writes neither it nor `mvhd`'s creation time from it |
//!
//! So the date is a [`glib::Date`], not a `DateTime`: the day is all `©day`
//! holds anyway. `description` is written even though `ffprobe -show_format`
//! doesn't surface it — it *is* in the file, in the XMP `uuid` box that
//! `GstTagXmpWriter` writes, which is what Adobe's and Apple's readers look
//! at. Nothing else carries a description on this muxer.
//!
//! **Tags cost the `moov` reserve nothing** (measured). `mp4mux` grows the
//! reserved header to fit them rather than spending the sample-table headroom:
//! with tags, without them, and with a 40 KB tag payload,
//! `reserved-duration-remaining` came back identical and the `free` box after
//! `moov` — the one [`crate::chapters::splice`] eats into — stayed exactly 842
//! bytes. The XMP lands in its own `uuid` box after that `free`, so the splice
//! sees the layout it always saw.
//!
//! And they cost the copy path no losslessness: every one of them is a header
//! box beside the tracks, and not a byte of any sample changes.
