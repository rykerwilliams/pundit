//! The lossless join (spec L): the whole match written by copying the
//! sources' own packets, with no decoder, no encoder, no overlay and no GPU.
//!
//! ```text
//! first, every source's header: filesrc ! qtdemux ! fakesink (the gate)
//! then, one source at a time:   filesrc ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! appsink
//!                                                 ! aacparse  ! appsink
//! into, for the whole output:   appsrc ! mp4mux ! filesink <path>.part
//!                               appsrc ! that same mp4mux
//!                               appsrc (the cues) ! that same mp4mux
//! ```
//!
//! **Rust owns the ordering, as the encoded export's pump does, and that is
//! the whole of why this cannot deadlock.** The first shape of this graph
//! gave the ordering to two `concat`s, one per track, feeding the muxer
//! directly. They switch source independently, so the muxer could end up
//! waiting for sound from source 2 while source 2's single `qtdemux` thread
//! was blocked pushing picture into a queue the video `concat` had not
//! reached yet — a deadlock, on roughly one run in three under load. Here
//! **only one source is open at a time**, its own demuxer thread carries each
//! packet straight into the muxer, and the one thing that ever waits is
//! [`Copying::wait_for_room`], whose condition says why it cannot wait for
//! good.
//!
//! **Which is why the headers are read first, in a pass of their own.** The
//! gate has to refuse a source that can't be joined *before* a byte is
//! written (spec L6), and what it reads is the caps `qtdemux` negotiates, so
//! every source is opened, asked and closed again — **one at a time**, in
//! order — before the muxing pipeline exists at all. A header read is
//! milliseconds against a copy's half-minute, and reading them in turn means
//! the file that is refused is the first one that can't be joined, whatever
//! the machine was doing.
//!
//! **The copying `appsink`s are `async=false`,** and that is not a detail: a
//! bin will not commit `PLAYING` while a sink's asynchronous state change is
//! still outstanding, and with two sinks on one demuxer thread and no queues
//! the second one's never completes — the first blocks that thread in preroll
//! before a packet of the other stream has been read. `async=false` takes the
//! sinks out of that accounting, so the pipeline reaches `PLAYING`, which
//! releases the preroll, and from there they render everything they are
//! given. In the **header** pass that same preroll is exactly the bound that
//! is wanted — one packet read per file, no more — so there the sinks are
//! ordinary `fakesink`s and nothing is ever taken to `PLAYING`.
//!
//! **The timestamps are not rewritten.** Each source's packets are pushed
//! with their own PTS and DTS — negative DTS, edit lists and all — and with
//! a copy of `qtdemux`'s own segment whose *base* is where that source starts
//! in the output. Running time is then continuous across the join, which is
//! what `concat`'s `adjust-base` did, and the muxer sees the same stream it
//! always did.
//!
//! **Where a source starts is the plan's own `start_frame`, and only that**
//! (spec L7). `concat` advanced each track by its own length, so the sound
//! slipped against the picture by every source's A/V delta and the slips added
//! up (measured: 9 ms over two sources). Taking the base from the plan instead
//! fixes both tracks to one instant *and* makes it the same instant the
//! chapters and the cues are placed at, which is the only way those three can
//! agree by construction.
//!
//! **The scoreboard rides inside the file as well as beside it** (spec T1).
//! When the run has cues, a third pad carries them as a `tx3g` text track —
//! the same lines the `.srt` gets — so the board survives the file being
//! copied to a phone or sent on, where a sidecar does not. It is the one pad
//! here that is not fed from a demuxer: [`Output::start`] pushes the whole
//! list, which is a couple of hundred kilobytes on a full match, and ends that
//! stream at once. **A requested pad that runs dry stalls the muxer**, so the
//! cues are never trickled: the track is complete before the first packet of
//! picture arrives, and from there it can only be drained.
//!
//! **Nothing downstream refuses a mismatch for us.** Concatenating a 320×240
//! and a 640×480 H.264 file through this graph produced no error and no
//! warning (measured): one file, one `stsd`, describing most of its samples
//! wrongly. [`declare`] is the only thing standing between the coach and a
//! silently broken 2 GB file, and it reads the caps `qtdemux` negotiates,
//! which is where the parameter sets already are.
