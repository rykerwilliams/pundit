//! The export's sound (spec E3): one decode pipeline per file, mixed per
//! output frame into the blocks the muxer's AAC branch takes.
//!
//! ```text
//! per file:  filesrc ! decodebin3 (the audio stream only)
//!            ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! appsink F32LE/48k/2ch
//! per frame: the regions covering it, read at their own offsets, scaled by
//!            `core::audio::envelope` and summed
//! ```
//!
//! **Core owns the splice, media owns the samples.** Which span of which file
//! is heard at each emitted sample, how loud, and the fades at its edges are
//! all [`Region`]s handed in on the job; nothing here decides any of it.
//!
//! **The mixed stream is the output timeline with its first
//! [`PRIMING_SAMPLES`] samples dropped.** `avenc_aac` prepends that many
//! samples of priming and re-derives its output times by counting samples from
//! the first buffer, so shifting the timestamps is absorbed and the sound
//! still lands 21.3 ms late; dropping the samples puts it where the picture is
//! (measured). Core already expresses the regions on that emitted timeline, so
//! there is nothing to compensate for here beyond starting at emitted sample
//! 0.
//!
//! **A file with no audio track is silence,** and so is one that can't be
//! read. The muxer's audio pad must be fed for the whole run either way — an
//! export of footage filmed without sound is still an export — and the bus
//! refuses a missing source or recording before the run starts.
