//! The source player: one long-lived `playbin3` holding one source at a time,
//! with the load sequence and a single-flight, latest-wins seek slot inside
//! (spec D1, D3, D4, D8).
//!
//! The player is driven from one thread — the bus thread. The sync handler
//! forwards every GStreamer message through `on_message`; the driving thread
//! feeds each one back into [`SourcePlayer::handle`], which turns it into
//! [`PlayerEvent`]s. Only the [`FrameMailbox`](crate::FrameMailbox) and the
//! [`PositionHandle`] are shared with other threads.
//!
//! **Why a slot.** `ASYNC_DONE` carries no seek seqnum, so the only way to know
//! which seek finished is to have one in flight. A request made while one is
//! in flight waits in `pending`, where a newer request replaces it.
//!
//! **Why `Settling`.** A pause (PLAYING → PAUSED) prerolls and posts an
//! `ASYNC_DONE` of its own. Were a seek issued right behind it, that
//! `ASYNC_DONE` would complete the seek before it landed. So a pause that goes
//! async occupies the slot until its `ASYNC_DONE` arrives, and a request made
//! meanwhile waits in `pending` like any other.
