//! The vector overlay layer, rasterized once per output frame (spec P4, E2).
//!
//! Phase 8 draws the strokes and the text bar; Phase 9's scoreboard joins them,
//! **last, over everything** (spec S3), and the player highlights go under all
//! of it (spec H5). Geometry stays in core ([`pundit_core::layout`] and
//! [`pundit_core::highlight`]), pixels stay here.
//!
//! **The rect is the output frame; the strokes are mapped into the picture.**
//! One layer carries both, because they belong to different spaces: the coach
//! drew on the picture, so a stroke is normalized to the letterboxed content
//! rect and its pen denormalizes against *that* height, while the bar is chrome
//! and belongs to the frame. Splitting them across two mixer pads would buy
//! nothing — the extra pad is free either way (measured) — and would put the
//! bar's background and its glyphs on different layers, which is what macOS had
//! to do to keep its PiP out of its own caption. The inset overlaps the bar
//! here too, and the split is still unnecessary: the bar stops where the inset
//! stands, background and line alike (`core::layout::bar_rect`).
//!
//! **The fonts are vendored** (`fonts/DejaVuSans*.ttf`, with their licence
//! beside them) and they are the only fonts loaded, because [`font_system`]
//! builds the database itself rather than letting `cosmic-text` scan the
//! machine. So an export looks the same here, on another coach's laptop and on
//! a CI runner with no fonts installed at all. Both faces load under the one
//! family, so **every [`Attrs`] states its weight**: the default would draw the
//! scoreboard's labels in whichever face the query happened to reach.
//!
//! **Premultiplied, which the mixer pad has to be told.** tiny-skia stores
//! premultiplied pixels; GStreamer's `RGBA` means straight alpha. Nothing here
//! demultiplies — the mixer pad carrying this buffer sets
//! `blend-function-src-rgb=one` instead (the destination function already
//! defaults to `one-minus-src-alpha`), which is premultiplied-over for free on
//! the GPU.
//!
//! **A fresh buffer per frame, no pool.** Drawing is sub-millisecond, while
//! recycling a pixmap would need destroy-notify bookkeeping to avoid
//! overwriting a frame still queued in the mixer.
