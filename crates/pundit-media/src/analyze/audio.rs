//! The analysis pass's sound (spec D1): one source video, decoded whole to the
//! 16 kHz mono core's signals are defined at.
//!
//! ```text
//! filesrc ! decodebin3 (the audio stream only)
//!         ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! appsink F32LE/16k/1ch
//! ```
//!
//! **No new decode path.** That is the export's own
//! [`Reader`](crate::composite::audio), asked for the caps transcription
//! already asks it for; this module is its third caller.
//!
//! **The whole half at once, in memory.** 16 kHz of `f32` is 64 KB a second,
//! so the longest file in the design footage is 27 MB — less than one decoded
//! 1080p frame costs twice over, and cheaper than any arrangement that streams
//! it. It is also what lets every rule in
//! [`signals`](pundit_core::signals) stay a pure function of a slice.
