//! The analysis pass's picture (spec D1): one source video read at five
//! frames a second, as a thumbnail small enough that what is left of it is
//! the framing.
//!
//! ```text
//! filesrc ! decodebin3 (the video stream only)
//!         ! videorate max-rate=5 ! glupload ! glcolorconvert ! glcolorscale
//!         ! RGBA 160x90 in GL memory ! gldownload ! appsink
//! ```
//!
//! **`videorate` before `glupload`**, so a frame that is going to be dropped
//! is never uploaded. **`decodebin3`**, so the hardware decoder's frames stay
//! in DMABuf memory to that point, and **[`Gl::shared`]**'s surfaceless EGL
//! display, never the UI's — this runs off the UI thread, and on CI it runs
//! on Mesa's llvmpipe with no GPU at all.
//!
//! **One pass, no seeking**, in file order from the first frame to the last.
//!
//! Two series come out of it, on the same decode:
//!
//! - **motion**, the mean absolute luma difference between consecutive
//!   thumbnails, five values a second — 8,500 `f32` for a 28-minute file;
//! - **thumbnails**, one a second on core's own small grid, which is about a
//!   megabyte for a half.
//!
//! Both are arithmetic over a 14,400-pixel buffer GL has already made, which
//! is analysis of a thumbnail rather than full-frame work, so the pixel rule
//! holds. Everything that reads either of them is in
//! [`motion`](pundit_core::motion).
