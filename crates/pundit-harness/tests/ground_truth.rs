//! The measurement tool: grade the detector against the coach's own tagged
//! matches (spec G3), sound and picture in **one run**.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d, because it needs whole matches of real footage that CI has
//! no copy of and never will — the repository is public and the footage shows
//! children. Run it on the reference laptop with
//!
//! ```text
//! PUNDIT_GROUND_TRUTH=B=/local/b:A=/local/a:C=/local/c \
//!   flock /tmp/claude-1000/cargo.lock nice -n 19 \
//!   cargo test --release -p pundit-harness --test ground_truth \
//!     -- --ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1
//! ```
//!
//! `:`-separated project folders, **first is the tuning match** (G2) and the
//! rest are held out. An entry may carry a one- or two-character label
//! (`B=/local/b`); without one a match is named by its position, `A`, `B`,
//! `C` … Either way nothing identifying — no folder name, no team name — ever
//! reaches the terminal.
//!
//! **One run, one analysis per source.** Every cue is read off the same
//! [`Analyzer`] output the app would produce, which is what makes the sound's
//! numbers and the picture's comparable at all: the sweeps are pure functions
//! of the series, so a whole grid of constants costs one decode (G2).
//!
//! **`--release`, and it is not optional.** The whistle bank is forty Goertzel
//! evaluations over every 32 ms window of a half, and an unoptimised build
//! spends about forty times as long on it as the one the coach would run.
//!
//! **The folders are read-only.** This test opens each project with
//! `store::read`, reads `kickoffs.txt` and decodes the source videos; it never
//! builds a `Bus`, never calls `store::write`, and writes no file inside a
//! project folder.
//!
//! `--test-threads=1` because the analysis decodes whole halves, and two at
//! once would fight over the decoder and ruin every timing line.
//!
//! # What this run answers
//!
//! | Prefix | The question |
//! |---|---|
//! | `TAGS`, `GAPS` | what the coach's tags alone say, with no detector |
//! | `RGAP`, `RSTAT` | V-3: how long a walk-back takes, and so what `W` is |
//! | `SIGNAL`, `MDIST` | what one analysis found and what it cost (V-6, V-8) |
//! | `DIAG` | per tag, the nearest signal that should have found it |
//! | `SWEEP` | the cheer cue's coverage against a chance baseline |
//! | `STILL`, `SSWEEP` | stillness, at quantiles of each half's **own** distribution |
//! | `WHIST`, `WSWEEP`, `PSEL` | periods from whistles alone: the long floor swept, and the loudest-whistle rule |
//! | `PICTURE`, `PSWEEP`, `PORT` | the kick-off picture, against templates held out by match |
//! | `RGRID`, `CHOSE` | the whole rule, swept on the tuning match and chosen there |
//! | `WCURVE` | the `W` trade, for the record — the headline is V-3's `W`, not this curve's best |
//! | `OGOAL`, `ORACLE`, `ONEAR` | the confirmation rule with the restarts **known** |
//! | `SCORE`, `CHANCE`, `SEEK` | the chosen rule on the held-out matches, against chance |
//! | `HIT`, `MISS`, `NEAR` | every goal it found, missed, and every cheer it threw away |
//!
//! The verdict is
//! `docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-24-match-vision-measurements.md`.
