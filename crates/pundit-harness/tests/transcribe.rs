//! Bus end to end: the transcription queue (Phase 10 spec S5–S7), on the test
//! transcriber — no model, no whisper build, no camera.
//!
//! Every clip here has a **real** recording with sound in it, because the
//! extraction runs before the seam does: the queue is what these tests are
//! about, but a clip whose file can't be read is a failure, and one test
//! wants exactly that.
//!
//! Layout per test: `<tmp>/config` holds the state file, `<tmp>/project` the
//! project and its `recordings/`, `<tmp>/media` the fixture game videos.
