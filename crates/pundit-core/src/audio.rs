//! The audio edit: which span of which file is heard at each output sample,
//! how loud, and the fades at its edges.
//!
//! Core owns the splice; media owns the samples (spec E3). The two tracks are
//! the game video's own audio — heard **only while the source is playing**, so
//! a freeze is silent — and the commentary recording, heard throughout its
//! entry.
//!
//! # The emitted timeline
//!
//! Every position here is an **emitted sample**: an index into the stream
//! handed to the AAC encoder, which is the output timeline with its first
//! [`PRIMING_SAMPLES`] samples dropped (spec E3, measured). So emitted sample
//! `s` is output time `(s + PRIMING_SAMPLES) / AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE`, and output
//! frame `n` is emitted sample `n · 1600 − 1024`.
//!
//! That shift is not cosmetic: the ramps have to live on the emitted timeline
//! or the first region's fade-in is inside the dropped head and the export
//! opens at full gain — the click the ramp rule exists to remove. Expressing
//! the regions themselves in emitted samples is what makes that true by
//! construction, and it leaves the caller one mapping instead of two: emitted
//! sample `s` of a region reads its file at
//! `source_offset + (s − out_samples.start) / AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE`.
