//! Pure logic for pundit.
//!
//! This crate declares **no media dependency** — not GStreamer, not an image or
//! font crate, not a feature that pulls one in. CI runs its tests on a runner
//! with no GStreamer installed, so adding one fails the build rather than
//! passing silently. If you need a media type here, you need a different
//! design.
