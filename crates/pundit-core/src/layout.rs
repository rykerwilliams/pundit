//! spec's "Layout constants the port must reproduce". Phase 7 needs the stroke
//! and PiP rows; the text bar (Phase 8) and the scoreboard (Phase 9) joined
//! them when something drew them.
//!
//! **Two spaces, and they differ only on a non-16:9 source** (BACKLOG #20,
//! settled here the way the parent spec recommended):
//!
//! - **Strokes live in the content rect** — the letterboxed picture, which is
//!   [`crate::zoom::Zoom::IDENTITY`]'s `transform`. They were drawn on the
//!   picture, so `line_width` denormalizes against *its* height and the
//!   overlay is rasterized at *its* size. Against the output rect they would
//!   stretch across the letterbox bars.
//! - **The PiP lives in output space**, overlapping those bars like broadcast
//!   furniture. It is chrome: the coach never drew it, so nothing ties it to
//!   the picture. So does the text bar (Phase 8).
