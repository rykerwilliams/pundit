//! What an exported file is called, and what it says about itself.
//!
//! Two things live here, because they are the same words twice over: what an
//! [`ExportTarget`] is called (in the sheet, and in the file name the app
//! builds from it), and the tag set that goes into the file's header so a
//! media library can read the match, the result and the teams off it without
//! opening the app.
//!
//! **No media dependency**, like the rest of this crate: [`file_tags`] is a
//! pure function of the project, the target and a date the caller supplies,
//! and `pundit-media` is what turns the result into MP4 header boxes.
//! It is the sibling of [`crate::whole_match`]'s chapter wording,
//! [`crate::reel`]'s captions and [`crate::scoreboard::chapter_events`]: one
//! place per kind of sentence the app writes into a file.
//!
//! **Where a tag can't be told the truth it is left out** rather than
//! guessed: a project with no scoreboard has no teams to name and no result
//! to report, so it gets a title from the project's own name and neither a
//! comment nor keywords.
