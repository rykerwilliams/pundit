//! Which strokes are on screen at a given record time, and how much of each.
//!
//! **A `.stroke` event's `record_time` is when the stroke FINISHED**, not when
//! it started. The recorder appends it on pen-up, and each point carries `t`
//! measured from the stroke's own start, so replay back-computes the start as
//! `record_time - points.last().t`. Everything keys off that back-computed
//! value, never off the event's timestamp.
//!
//! Getting this wrong makes every stroke appear late by its own duration —
//! proportional to how long the coach held the pen, so long strokes are
//! visibly wrong while quick flicks look fine. That asymmetry makes it a
//! genuinely nasty bug to catch by eye.
//!
//! **Auto-clear counts from pen-up**, i.e. from the event's own `record_time`,
//! which is the one time here that is not back-computed. Only the start is.
