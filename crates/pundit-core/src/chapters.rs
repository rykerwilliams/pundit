//! The file's chapters as a block of text to paste into a YouTube
//! description.
//!
//! A YouTube upload ignores the chapters inside an MP4 — the `chpl` box
//! [`crate::plan::CompilationPlan::chapters`] is written into
//! (`pundit-media`'s `chapters` module) is read by `ffprobe`, mpv and
//! VLC and by nothing else. What YouTube reads is the description, so the
//! same list goes beside the file as plain text the coach can paste.
//!
//! **YouTube is all or nothing.** Break any one of its rules and it silently
//! shows no chapters at all, leaving a description full of stray timestamps
//! and no way to tell what went wrong. So the rules are enforced here rather
//! than hoped for:
//!
//! - the first line is exactly `0:00`;
//! - there are at least three lines;
//! - consecutive lines are at least ten seconds apart, ascending;
//! - a line is `m:ss` or `h:mm:ss`, then a space, then the title.
//!
//! The app's own chapters are a coach's moments, not a list built to those
//! rules, so [`chapter_list`] is where the two are reconciled. Like
//! [`crate::cues`] and [`crate::metadata`] it is pure: media writes the
//! string it returns and knows nothing about the format.

///
/// **A first chapter that isn't at zero.** Under ten seconds in, it is moved
/// to `0:00` — it is the opening chapter either way, and inventing a line
/// above it would throw away the words the coach wrote for the thing that
/// starts the film. Ten seconds or more in, a `0:00 `[`LEAD_IN`] line is
/// prepended instead, which names the stretch before the first moment rather
/// than mislabelling it.
///
/// **A chapter inside ten seconds of the one before it is dropped, not
/// merged.** Merging would invent a title ("Kick-off / Rovers goal 1-0") that
/// is neither of the two and that nothing else in the app would ever write;
/// dropping keeps every line exactly as worded. It is the **later** one that
/// goes, so a kept timestamp never lands after the start of the moment it
/// names. The same comparison drops a chapter that is out of order, so the
/// list is ascending whatever it is handed.
///
/// **Fewer than three survivors write no file at all** (the caller treats
/// `None` as "remove the stale one"). A two-line list is not a shorter list
/// of chapters, it is a list YouTube ignores: pasting it gives a description
/// with loose timestamps in it and no chapters, and no hint why. A file that
/// only exists when it works is the one that can be pasted without reading
/// it.
///
/// Times are floored to whole seconds, because a timestamp is a seek target:
/// `0:14` must not land after the moment `14.9 s` names. A non-finite or
/// negative time — which no plan produces — is skipped rather than guessed.
