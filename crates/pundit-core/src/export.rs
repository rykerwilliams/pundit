//! The edit an export renders: which source frame and zoom land at each output
//! frame.
//!
//! Core owns the edit; media owns the pixels (spec X1). The schedule carries
//! **no play/freeze flag**: the pump answers "last decoded frame with PTS ≤
//! `source_time`", so a repeated `source_time` re-pushes the same buffer. That
//! one rule covers freezes, 25→30 fps duplication and 60→30 fps drops.
//!
//! [`RateWindow`] lives here too: it measures the same frames the schedule
//! hands out, so a run's progress and its estimate count the same thing.
