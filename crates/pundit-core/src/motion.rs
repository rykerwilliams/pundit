//! What the picture does (spec D1, D3): where it holds still, and where it
//! looks like a kick-off — as pure functions over the number series and the
//! thumbnail grid [`analyze::motion`] decodes.
//!
//! Media decodes; core measures, exactly as for [`signals`](crate::signals).
//! Two series come out of the one decode pass, five frames a second of
//! [`MOTION_HZ`] motion and one thumbnail a second, and this module is
//! everything that reads them.
//!
//! # Two ways to find a kick-off
//!
//! **Stillness** is the spec's own (D3): after a goal the players walk back,
//! the ball sits on the centre spot, the virtual camera holds, and then the
//! restart is sudden. It asks nothing of the picture but that it stop
//! changing, which is why it also fires on an injury, a water break and every
//! long throw-in.
//!
//! **Picture similarity** is the coach's: "kick offs are a kind of known
//! picture". On this footage they are right and it is worth measuring
//! separately — the camera is a fixed tripod with a virtual pan, so the
//! halfway line, the centre circle and the two teams split either side of it
//! frame almost identically at every kick-off of every match. A kick-off is
//! then a frame that correlates with a **known** one.
//!
//! The comparison is a zero-mean, unit-norm correlation ([`Thumbnail`]), so
//! two kick-offs an hour and a venue apart are the same picture through
//! different light. What it cannot survive is a different camera position,
//! which is the question of whether one match's [`Template`] finds another's
//! kick-offs at all, and so of whether a shipped detector needs per-match
//! calibration. P3 measures it; nothing here assumes the answer.
//!
//! **Every constant here is an initial value that P3 replaces** with one
//! chosen on the tuning match (spec G2), and they are `pub` so the
//! ground-truth run can print them and sweep around them.
