//! Replaying the commentary event log into a playback timeline.
//!
//! Two functions answer closely-related questions and are **deliberately not
//! identical** at end-of-source:
//!
//! - [`playback_segments`] is authoritative for **which frame to pull**. It
//!   caps freeze anchors at `source_duration - 0.05` so a pull-based decoder is
//!   never asked for a frame at or past the end of the file.
//! - [`source_time`] is authoritative for **where the coach actually was**: the
//!   uncapped answer, and the reference the segment walk is checked against.
//!
//! The 50 ms cap is a decoder-safety pullback, not a semantic answer, so the
//! two agree to within 50 ms past EOF and exactly everywhere else. That gap is
//! pinned by a test on purpose; do not "fix" one side to match the other.
//!
//! **The scoreboard's match clock reads the displayed frame**, so it is
//! [`crate::export::FrameSpec::source_time`] — the segment walk's answer — not
//! this module's. A clock that disagreed with the picture by 50 ms at a freeze
//! would be showing a frame that is not on screen.
//!
//! For that claim to hold, **both functions clamp the play/pause anchor to
//! `[0, source_duration]` at assignment.** The Swift original assigns anchors
//! raw, which lets a negative anchor hand the decoder a `source_start` of -5 s
//! and put the two functions seconds apart — the same class of bug the freeze
//! cap prevents at the other end of the range. Clamping changes nothing for an
//! in-range anchor, and nothing for an anchor past the end (which the cap and
//! the available-source floor already handle).
