//! The kick-off pattern and the coach's confirmation rule (spec D3, D4), as
//! pure functions over the series [`signals`](crate::signals) and
//! [`motion`](crate::motion) produce.
//!
//! The coach's own rule, in one sentence: **a goal is a cheer that is followed
//! by a restart.** So the pattern is found in the picture — the players walk
//! back, the ball sits on the centre spot, the camera holds, and then play
//! resumes — and the sound is what says which of those restarts was a goal.
//!
//! # The stages, and what each one costs
//!
//! 1. [`kickoffs`] reads the picture: a still interval, then motion again for
//!    [`RESUME_SECONDS`]. Its time `K` is a whistle near the end of the hold
//!    when there is one, and the end of the hold when there is not (D3).
//! 2. [`suggest`] reads the sound against those: the **first** kick-off in a
//!    source is the period start, the **last long whistle** is the period end,
//!    and every other kick-off is a goal — **high** tier when a cheer stands
//!    in `[window start, K − 15 s]`, **quiet** when none does.
//! 3. [`near_misses`] is the other half of the same rule: a cheer with no
//!    kick-off behind it is reported and never suggested, because a rule that
//!    suggests every cheer is a rule that suggests the crowd.
//!
//! # What P3 measured, and what it means for these constants
//!
//! **Read every number here as a measurement, not a setting.** On the three
//! tagged matches (2026-09-24, six halves, sixteen goals):
//!
//! - the cheer covers **7 of 16** goals at its initial constants and never more
//!   than 12 anywhere in a sweep, and only then at eighty firings a half;
//! - stillness at an absolute θ finds **1 of 6** tagged kick-offs, and the
//!   quantile threshold this module now reads
//!   ([`STILL_QUANTILE`](crate::motion::STILL_QUANTILE)) is what makes the cue
//!   mean the same thing in two venues 27 dB and a camera apart;
//! - **nine post-goal restarts have now been timed** (V-3), and they run
//!   20.5–46.4 s after the goal, not the 30–90 s the spec guessed — so
//!   [`GOAL_WINDOW_SECONDS`] is 60 s and not 150.
//!
//! **The whole rule was then swept over 180 combinations and chosen on the
//! tuning match**: a stillness quantile of 0.50, a hold of 10 s, a cheer 10 dB
//! over its median for 0.5 s, the gate on. `W` is **not** in that grid — it is
//! measured, and a grid free to widen the window always holds a point that
//! claims half the match and reads the coverage back as recall. The picture
//! half of the point is [`motion`](crate::motion)'s constants; the sound half
//! is **not** — [`signals`](crate::signals)' own were chosen by the cue's own
//! measurement, and the two differ. On the held-out matches that point scores
//! **7 goals of 9 with 30 false ones**, against a chance recall of 0.30,
//! because its windows cover 29% of the match. **Lift +0.48**, up from +0.15
//! at the guessed `W`: the rule knows something, and it is still a row the
//! coach would dismiss four times in five, so **nothing here is wired to the
//! UI.**
//!
//! **What the restarts showed is where the fault is.** Given the nine timed
//! restarts instead of the picture's guesses, the sound confirms **9 of 9**
//! goals — every goal's cheer stands inside `[K − W, K − 15 s]` of its real
//! restart. The confirmation rule is right; what fails is [`kickoffs`], which
//! offers about 21 candidate restarts a half where a half holds three.
//!
//! The verdict those numbers add up to is
//! `docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-09-24-match-vision-measurements.md`, and it is
//! what to read before trusting any rule in this file.
