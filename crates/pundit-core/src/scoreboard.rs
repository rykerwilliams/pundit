//! The scoreboard: what the project stores, and the clock and score it shows.

//! The coach tags kick-off, half-time, full-time and each goal while scanning;

//! **absolute time** on the virtual-concat timeline ([`Project::abs_seconds`]),
//! so the same call answers for a scan position, a preview frame and an export
//! frame. Nothing caches a per-clip constant: macOS did, and every pause in a

//! (BACKLOG #27).
//!
//! **The match clock is the *displayed* frame's source time**, i.e.
//! [`crate::export::FrameSpec::source_time`], not [`crate::timeline::source_time`]
