//! The undo history.
//!
//! Ported from macOS `UndoController`. Pure: it holds the two stacks and
//! their push / cap / eviction rules, and never applies an action or touches a
//! file. The bus applies each action, moves recordings in and out of
//! `recordings/.trash/`, and shreds what eviction returns. Deviations (Phase 3
//! spec C1, C2):
//!
//! - **Any number of deletes can be undone.** macOS kept at most one delete
//!   across both stacks and evicted the previous one on every delete. Here a
//!   delete leaves the history only when the cap drops it or
//!   [`UndoController::purge_for_source_change`] removes it, so there is one
//!   `push`: deletes need no separate entry point.
//! - **Eviction purges the clip's edits.** An evicted clip can never return,
//!   so its `EditClip` entries could only no-op; macOS kept them, and Ctrl+Z
//!   silently consumed them.
//! - **Take, then file.** macOS moved an action to the other stack as it
//!   popped it. Here the caller takes it, applies it, and files what it
//!   applied — possibly an updated action (a redone delete files the clip as
//!   it was when trashed), or nothing if its target is gone.
//! - **Edits snapshot one field** ([`ClipEdit`]), not the whole clip, so
//!   undoing an edit can't revert a later reorder.
