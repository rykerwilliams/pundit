//! Coalescing rapid skip presses into a small number of player seeks.
//!
//! **This is a pure state machine with no clock.** It never compares a time
//! against a window; it is driven entirely by "is a seek in flight?" plus three
//! events from the caller. `burst_window` is never compared against anything —
//! it is only handed *back* so the caller can arm its own debounce timer. The
//! Swift original accepts a `nowMonotonicSeconds` parameter in all three
//! methods and reads it in none of them; that dead parameter is dropped here,
//! and its absence is why these tests need no fake clock.
//!
//! The policy: the **first** press of any sequence seeks exact. No
//! coarse-then-refine for a single keypress — on long-GOP HEVC the coarse
//! landing visibly snaps to the keyframe before the target (e.g. +2 s for a
//! +3 s skip) and the burst-end settle then jumps the rest of the way, which
//! reads as a double-seek for one keypress. Follow-up presses during flight
//! only accumulate the target; the coarse seek is issued when the leading exact
//! *lands*. Once the user stops pressing, an exact seek settles the frame.
