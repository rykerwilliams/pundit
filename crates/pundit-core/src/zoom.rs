//! Zoom and pan state.
//!
//! **Exactly one transform lives here, and it is not the one the macOS
//! compositors call.** The Swift original carries three:
//! `transform(sourceSize:destSize:)` (dead outside its own tests),
//! `deltaTransform(viewportSize:)` and `deltaTransformForCIImage(...)` (a sign
//! flip for Core Image's bottom-left origin). All three map the normalized
//! source point `0.5 + pan` to the viewport centre, but they disagree on base
//! fit (letterbox vs. pre-stretched) and on what `pan` is a fraction of
//! (displayed image vs. viewport). Since this port letterboxes, the surviving
//! formula is the letterbox-fit one. Both delta variants are deliberately
//! absent: reaching for `deltaTransform` because it is what the live
//! compositors call would get pan wrong on every source whose aspect ratio
//! differs from the output's.
//!
//! `PartialEq` here is **bit equality on purpose**. The recorder's zoom dedupe
//! is `if z == last_captured { return }`, and its intent is "the gesture fired
//! but `snapped().clamped()` collapsed to the same notch as last time". An
//! epsilon comparison would suppress genuinely distinct keyframes and break the
//! anchor-keyframe pattern that keeps replay from drifting across quiet gaps.
