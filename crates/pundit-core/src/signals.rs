//! What the crowd and the referee sound like (spec D2): whistles, cheers and
//! applause, as pure functions over a slice of 16 kHz mono samples.
//!
//! Media decodes; core measures. Everything here is a number series over the
//! same frame grid — 32 ms windows on a 16 ms hop — and every threshold is
//! **relative to a 60 s rolling median of the signal's own band**. Nothing
//! absolute can work: the two venues in the design footage differ by about
//! 27 dB in the whistle band, so a level tuned on one is noise on the other
//! [measured].
//!
//! **Every constant here is an initial value that P3 replaces** with one
//! chosen on the tuning match (spec G2). They are `pub` so the ground-truth
//! run can print them on its `RUN` line and sweep around them.
//!
//! # Why a whistle needs a tonality term
//!
//! A level rule on the whistle band does not work. Measured on one whole half,
//! the two loudest 2–4.5 kHz events were the two loudest **cheers**: a shout
//! is broadband and leaks straight into the band, and the half's own final
//! whistle had no level excursion at any threshold tried. So a whistle is a
//! peak that is loud against the band's recent past ([`WHISTLE_SNR_DB`]) and
//! holds its pitch ([`WHISTLE_PITCH_HZ`]) **and** stands over the rest of its
//! own window ([`WHISTLE_TONALITY_DB`]).
//!
//! The last term is the one that is easy to think redundant, because most
//! broadband sound fails the pitch hold on its own: a noise burst's loudest
//! bin hops about, and a run breaks the moment it hops a bin too far. What it
//! catches is sound that is broadband **and** steady — a horn, a buzzer, a
//! plastic trumpet — whose loudest bin does not move for as long as it lasts.
//! Measured on the synthetic one in `tests/signals.rs`: 31 dB over the band's
//! median, one bin from first window to last, and 5.5 dB over the rest of its
//! own window. Level and pitch call that a whistle; tonality is what says no.
//!
//! # Why a texture cue as well as a level one
//!
//! [`cheers`] asks one question: did the crowd band get louder than it has
//! recently been? Measured over six halves that found 7 of 16 tagged goals and
//! never more than 11 anywhere in a threshold sweep — a handful of parents on a
//! touchline is not loud from the halfway line, whatever the threshold.
//!
//! Applause is quiet but **textured**: a train of sharp broadband transients,
//! tens a second, each with a millisecond attack and almost no sustain. A shout
//! is one sustained broadband sound, wind is smooth, a whistle is a tone — none
//! of them is a train of transients. So [`clap_texture`] measures the *shape*
//! of the sound above 2 kHz rather than its level: **the onset rate**, how many
//! sharp rises of [`ONSET_RISE_DB`] a second the band's 2 ms envelope holds,
//! taken **in dB over its own 60 s rolling median** exactly as a level is,
//! because a venue's baseline clatter differs as much as its baseline level.
//!
//! ## What it measured, and why it is not the detector
//!
//! The cue is real and it is not enough. Over the same six halves and the same
//! sixteen tagged goals, compared against [`cheers`] **at matched firings a
//! half** on the two held-out matches:
//!
//! | firings a half | level (`cheers`) | texture (`claps`) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | ~6 | 4/9 | 3/9 |
//! | ~13–19 | 6/9 at 13, 8/9 at 19 | 4/9 at 19 |
//! | ~57–67 | 9/9 at 57 | 6/9 at 67 |
//!
//! The texture never wins at a firing rate anyone would keep, and the union of
//! the two is worse than the level cue alone at the same total rate. It does
//! win on the one match whose crowd is inaudible — 4 of 7 goals against the
//! level cue's 1 — which is why it is kept here rather than deleted, and why
//! it is **the tuning match**, so that win is exactly the one a held-out split
//! exists to distrust.
//!
//! Two things measured and **not** kept, so they are not rebuilt: the
//! envelope's modulation depth (its 95th percentile over its own median across
//! a second) scored 0/9 at every firing rate under 30 a half and barely over
//! chance above that; and spectral flatness is [`WHISTLE_TONALITY_DB`] upside
//! down, which the whistle work already measured as no separator of a shout
//! from anything.
//!
//! # Why no FFT crate
//!
//! Core declares four dependencies and an audit fails a fifth. The bank is
//! forty hand-written Goertzel evaluations per window, which is the whole of
//! the arithmetic that an FFT would have saved.
