# Linux Port — Phase 2 Plan

**Date:** 2026-09-19
**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-19-linux-port-phase-2-design.md` (decisions cited as D1–D12)
**Status:** Reviewed. Simplification and correctness passes are applied; the correctness pass built the dependency set and tested the GStreamer claims on the reference laptop.

**Goal:** everything on the spec's "Done when" list works on the reference laptop.

**Execution.** `CLAUDE.md` names `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`, but it isn't installed. Instead, each task runs in a fresh subagent that is given this plan, the spec and `CLAUDE.md`, and no chat history. After each task the orchestrator runs the `verify` skill and commits that task on its own. CI must stay green at every commit, so each task updates CI when it adds a new requirement.

**Environment.** The reference laptop runs Ubuntu 24.04, GStreamer 1.24.2 with dev headers installed, an Intel UHD GPU, and X11. Anything that needs a display runs there. Screenshots (`import -window root /path.png`) can be read back to check what's on screen.

**Known facts. Don't re-derive these.**
- **Build.** A clean build takes about 6 minutes of wall time and 34 CPU-minutes. `skia-bindings` downloads prebuilt binaries, so neither clang nor ninja is needed.
- **Slint API.**
  - `PointerScrollEvent` has `modifiers`.
  - `FocusScope`'s `capture-key-pressed` runs before the focused element.
  - `DragArea`/`DropArea` are stable in 1.18.
  - Skia uses EGL on Linux.
  - With `default-features = false`, the required compat feature is `compat-1-18`.
- **GStreamer 1.24.2 behavior.**
  - A flushing seek in PAUSED or PLAYING posts `ASYNC_DONE`.
  - PAUSED→PLAYING posts none; PLAYING→PAUSED posts one.
  - A READY→uri→PAUSED load posts its **own** `ASYNC_DONE`, before any seek.
  - `ASYNC_DONE` carries no seek seqnum.
  - An appsink whose samples are never pulled **never posts EOS**.
  - WebM can't carry `image-orientation`.
  - `glupload`'s uploader can't be queried; its sink-pad caps show which one is used: `memory:DMABuf` means zero-copy, plain `video/x-raw` means copied.
- **Edition 2021.** The workspace is edition 2021, so code copied from Slint's example must not use let-chains.

---

## Task 0 — Toolchain, CI, and the zero-copy gate

1. **Workspace `Cargo.toml`.**
   - Set `resolver = "3"`, which is MSRV-aware. Without it, `gstreamer` 0.25.3 locks `kstring` 2.0.5, which needs Rust 1.96.
   - Set `rust-version = "1.92"`.
   - Add these workspace dependencies:
     - `slint` 1.18 with `default-features = false` and features `std`, `backend-winit`, `renderer-skia-opengl`, `compat-1-18`;
     - `slint-build` 1.18;
     - `gstreamer`, `-video`, `-app`, `-gl`, `-gl-egl` and `-pbutils` at 0.25, each with feature `v1_24` and nothing higher;
     - `glutin_egl_sys` 0.7, for `eglGetCurrentContext`/`eglGetCurrentDisplay`, loaded through Slint's `get_proc_address` as in Slint's example;
     - `rfd` at the current 0.17.x with its default xdg-portal backend, which needs no GTK packages.

   `pundit-core` gets none of these.
2. **CI** (`.github/workflows/rust.yml`).
   - `workspace` job:
     - apt-installs `libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev libxkbcommon-dev libegl-dev libgl-dev`;
     - adds `Swatinem/rust-cache`;
     - pins Rust 1.92, since this is the job that compiles Slint and GStreamer, so this is where the pin checks something;
     - runs fmt, clippy and `cargo test --workspace`. No test may open a window.
   - `core` job: unchanged, still with no GStreamer.
3. **Spike** `crates/pundit-app/examples/zero_copy_spike.rs`. It stays in the repo as a diagnostic.
   - Select the Skia renderer (D2).
   - In `RenderingSetup`, assert `eglGetCurrentContext()` is non-null, wrap the context, and answer `NeedContext` from a sync handler. The handler returns `BusSyncReply::Drop` for everything, forwarding non-context messages.
   - Play a path given as an argument through `playbin3` with the D1 GL sink bin, drawing each frame via `BorrowedOpenGLTextureBuilder`.
   - Log the decoder factory, the caps on `glupload`'s sink pad, and the GL platform.
4. **Sub-pixel check.** In the spike, move the `Image` very slowly by setting fractional `x` and `width` values, and confirm with before/after screenshots that it doesn't visibly step. Record the result here.
5. **Gate.** Run the spike on `~/Downloads/phone_Videos/20260502121738_000004.MP4` with `GST_DEBUG=glupload:6`. The gate passes only if all of these hold:
   - the decoder is hardware;
   - the caps into `glupload` are `memory:DMABuf`, and the debug log shows `DirectDmabufExternal`;
   - the platform is EGL;
   - a screenshot shows the frame;
   - playback runs without dropped-frame warnings.

   **If the gate fails, stop and report. Don't start Task 1.**

Commit: `chore(app): Phase 2 toolchain, CI and zero-copy spike`.

### Task 0 notes (2026-09-19, reference laptop)

- **Gate: passed.** Measured with `GST_DEBUG=glupload:6 zero_copy_spike 20260502121738_000004.MP4 --quit-after 15`.
  - Decoder: `vah265dec`.
  - Caps into `glupload`: `video/x-raw(memory:DMABuf), format=DMA_DRM, 2560x1440, drm-format=NV12:0x0100000000000002`.
  - Uploader: `Changing uploader from None to DirectDmabufExternal`, and it stayed there. There were 434 `DirectDmabufExternal returned 1` uploads in about 14.5 s, which is 30 fps, and no `Raw Data`. The single `Dmabuf Passthrough` line is the first candidate being tried before it is rejected.
  - Platform: Slint's context is `EGL`/`GLES2`. The context `glupload` uses is `EGL` with an `EGL` display.
  - Playback produced no QoS messages and no warnings, and exited cleanly at `--quit-after`.
  - Screenshot: yes, the camera frame is visible. The root-window screenshot showed only the Cinnamon screensaver, which was active on `:0`. Grabbing the spike's own window with `import -window <id>` works through it, because the compositor redirects windows.
- **Sub-pixel check: `x` steps and `width` doesn't.** Screenshots were taken while paused on the preroll frame, comparing mean absolute luma over the interior.
  - `x` = 0.25 is identical to `x` = 0 (difference 0.000), and `x` = 0.5 is identical to `x` = 1. The Skia renderer rounds the origin to whole physical pixels whenever the transform is translate-only (`i-slint-renderer-skia` `itemrenderer.rs:474-512`, `pixel_align_origin_auto_restore`, used by `draw_image_impl`).
  - `width` = 800.25 and 800.5 each differ from both 800 and 801, so scaling is continuous.
  - Consequence for D9: zoom scale is continuous, but pan and zoom offsets move in steps of 1 physical pixel. The spec's claim of "continuous, sub-pixel zoom" is only half true. Whether a 1 px step is visible during slow pans is for the human to judge in Task 7.
- **Build.** The first build of the spike took 4 min 36 s of wall time and 28.5 CPU-minutes.
  - The workspace also passes clippy on Rust 1.92 with `--locked`. `kstring` is held at 2.0.2, as the resolver note predicted.
  - `cargo test --workspace` passed: 152 tests, all in core.
- **Surprises.**
  - The deps the spike needs are `[dev-dependencies]` of `pundit-app` until Task 5 uses them for real. `rfd` and `slint-build` are workspace-only for now.
  - Task 5 says to delete this example once the window works, but step 3 above says it stays as a diagnostic. Decide which in Task 5.

## Task 1 — Core additions (no GStreamer)

Work in `crates/pundit-core`, following the `port-swift-module` skill.

- **`SourceRef.display_aspect: f64`** (D7): required and camelCase. Update fixtures; `formatVersion` stays 7.
- **`Project::locate(abs) -> (usize, f64)`** (D4), following the spec's four rules. Tests cover each rule, plus a round trip with `abs_seconds` away from boundaries.
- **`Project::source_is_referenced(i) -> bool`**: true if any clip or match event references the source. `remove_source` uses it, and so does the UI's disabled remove button.
- **`Project::remove_source(i, current: usize) -> Result<Option<usize>, SourceReferenced>`**:
  - it refuses while the source is referenced;
  - it decrements higher `source_index` values in clips and match events;
  - it returns the remapped current index, or `None` if the current source was removed.
- **`Project::move_source(from, to, current: usize) -> usize`**: moves one source and remaps clips, match events and the current index. A move is always a valid permutation, so no validation is needed.
- **`Project::check_aspect(candidate, excluding: Option<usize>) -> Result<(), AspectMismatch>`**:
  - the reference is the first source other than `excluding`; if there's no such source, there's no gate;
  - the rule is: both aspects > 0 and `|a−b| / max < 0.005`;
  - test the 0.005 edge in both directions, and the sole-source relink.
- **`Zoom::content_fraction(cursor_x, cursor_y, frame_w, frame_h, area_w, area_h) -> (f64, f64)`** in `zoom.rs`, next to `transform`:
  - maps a cursor in window-area coordinates to fractions of the letterboxed content rect, clamped to `[0, 1]`;
  - Phase 6 strokes will reuse it;
  - tests: 16:9 and 4:3 frames in a 16:9 area, including a cursor in the letterbox bars.
- Tests for `remove_source` (refusal, remap, current removed) and `move_source` (forward, backward, current moved).

Commit: `feat(core): Phase 2 locate, source remaps, aspect gate, content fraction`.

## Task 2 — Media: fixtures and probe

Work in `crates/pundit-media`.

- **`pub mod fixtures`**. Every function writes into a `&Path` directory the caller supplies, so `tempfile` stays a dev-dependency. There's no feature flag.
  - `webm(dir, name, secs, w, h, fps, keyint)`: `videotestsrc` and `audiotestsrc ! vp8enc`/`vorbisenc ! webmmux`. Set `samplesperbuffer` so the audio matches the video duration exactly; at 44.1 kHz and 30 fps that's `samplesperbuffer=1470`. Uses the base and good plugins only.
  - `rotated_mp4(dir)`: `videotestsrc ! jpegenc ! taginject scope=global tags="image-orientation=rotate-90" ! qtmux`. Verified: Discoverer reports this tag.
  - `audio_only(dir)`: a file with no video stream.
- **`probe(path) -> Result<Probe, ProbeError>`** using `Discoverer`.
  - `Probe { duration_seconds, display_aspect }`, where the aspect includes PAR.
  - Errors are `NoVideo`, `Rotated(String)` and `Unreadable(String)`.
  - Orientation is read from `DiscovererInfo::tags()` (the global tag list) through a pure `check_orientation(tag: Option<&str>)`, which is unit-tested on its own.
  - Tests: duration within one frame of the fixture; aspect within a **relative** 0.1%, since PAR rounding in WebM gives 1.7771 for 16:9; each error case.

Commit: `feat(media): test fixtures and source probe`.

## Task 3 — Media: the player and its seek slot

`crates/pundit-media/src/player.rs`. The load sequence, the seek slot and EOS handling all live here (spec crate table). The bus sees only concat time.

- **Video sink.** `video_sink(kind: SinkKind) -> (gst::Element, FrameMailbox)`.
  - `SinkKind::Gl` builds the D1 bin, `glupload ! glcolorconvert ! appsink(GLMemory RGBA 2D)`.
  - `SinkKind::System` builds `appsink(video/x-raw)` for tests.
  - Both wire `new_sample` and `new_preroll` into the same single-slot, latest-wins `FrameMailbox`: a buffer, its `VideoInfo` (which includes PAR), and a redraw callback. Because samples are always pulled, EOS always arrives.
- **Constructor.** `SourcePlayer::new(video_sink, audio_sink, on_message: impl Fn(gst::Message) + Send + Sync + 'static)`.
  - It creates one `playbin3` with flags `0x53` and installs a sync handler.
  - The sync handler answers `NeedContext` from a private context slot and passes every other message to `on_message`. It returns `BusSyncReply::Drop`, so nothing piles up on the async bus.
- **`set_gl_context(display, context)`** fills the context slot. A player built with a GL sink refuses to go beyond READY until it has been called (D3).
- **Seek machinery.** `seek_to(uri: &str, secs: f64, accurate: bool, origin: Origin) -> Result<()>`, where `Origin` is `Skip`, `Scrub` or `System`.
  - Flight states: `Idle`, `Loading { target }`, `Seeking { target }`, plus a latest-wins `pending` slot.
  - A different `uri` starts a load: READY, set `uri`, PAUSED. On the load's `ASYNC_DONE` the player issues the seek. In the `Loading` state it accepts `ASYNC_DONE` only when `state(ClockTime::ZERO)` returns `(Success, Paused, VoidPending)`, which guards against a stale one.
  - On the seek's `ASYNC_DONE`: the seek is complete; issue the pending target if there is one.
  - A request made while busy **replaces** `pending`. Report the displaced request's origin, so a displaced `Skip` can reset the coordinator.
  - If a seek call fails, or media isn't loaded, complete that flight immediately with `SeekFailed`.
  - `set_playing(bool)` records `want_playing`. It's applied once the flight is idle, so there's no flash of frame 0 during a load.
  - `clear()` drops the flight and the pending target.
- **`handle(&gst::Message) -> Vec<PlayerEvent>`**. Events:
  - `SeekDone { origin }` and `SeekDisplaced { origin }`;
  - `SeekFailed { origin }`;
  - `Loaded { diagnostics }`;
  - `Eos`: **ignored while a flight is busy**, because an EOS posted before a flushing seek is stale;
  - `Error(String)`: also clears the flight.
- **`Diagnostics`** is a plain struct holding the decoder factory, the caps on `glupload`'s sink pad and the GL platform. The bus logs it.
- **Volume.** `set_volume(linear)` sets `volume = x³`.
- **Position.** `position_handle() -> PositionHandle`: a clonable, `Send` wrapper that can only call `query_position` (D5).
- **Tests.** Use `SinkKind::System` with `fakesink sync=true` for audio, and the Task 2 fixtures. Assertions use the mailbox sample's PTS and dimensions, never the pixel format: the laptop picks `vavp8dec` (NV12) while CI uses `vp8dec` (I420).
  - Load and preroll.
  - An ACCURATE seek lands within one frame.
  - Latest-wins: three quick requests produce two flights, and the middle one is reported as displaced.
  - Exactly one `SeekDone` per flight.
  - A cross-source load lands on its target, and the dimensions change between fixtures of different sizes.
  - A seek in the final second stays in the source.
  - `Eos` arrives at the end.
  - A failed seek doesn't wedge the slot.
  - The volume value is `x³`.

Commit: `feat(media): playbin3 source player with internal seek slot`.

## Task 4a — Bus: project and sources, with harness tests

`crates/pundit-app/src/bus/`, which must be constructible **without Slint**: `Bus::spawn(sinks: SinkKind, events: Box<dyn Fn(Event) + Send>) -> BusHandle`.

- **Input channel.** One `std::sync::mpsc` channel carries `enum Input { Cmd(Command), Gst(gst::Message) }`. The player's `on_message` wraps each message as `Input::Gst`. The loop uses `recv_timeout` with the skip-debounce deadline.
- **Commands.**
  - Project: `OpenProject(PathBuf)`, `RestoreLastProject`, `RenameProject`.
  - Sources: `AddSource(PathBuf)`, `RemoveSource(usize)`, `MoveSource { from, to }`, `RelinkSource(usize, PathBuf)`.
  - Transport (4b): `TogglePlay`, `Skip { delta }`, `ScrubMove { abs }`, `ScrubRelease { abs }`, `SetVolume { value, commit }`.
  - Lifecycle: `GlReady { display, context }`, `Shutdown { ack }`. `Shutdown` goes to NULL, acks and exits; it also serves as `RenderingTeardown`.
- **Events.**
  - `ProjectOpened(Arc<Project>)`, sent on every successful open; the UI resets zoom on it (D9).
  - `ProjectChanged(Arc<Project>)`.
  - `Position { source_index, target_abs: Option<f64> }`, with the target in concat seconds.
  - `Playing(bool)`.
  - `Missing(Vec<bool>)`, one entry per source.
  - `Error(UserError)`, where `UserError` is `AspectMismatch`, `Rotated`, `NoVideo`, `UnreadableProject`, `LegacyProject`, `TooNewProject`, `SourceReferenced` or `Io`.
- **Project lifecycle (D6).**
  - Read first, then commit. On `MissingProjectJson`, create a project; on any other error, leave everything unchanged.
  - After any open: apply `scan_volume` to the player, clear the seek slot and reset the coordinator.
  - The state file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pundit/state.json` is a tiny module. Restore opens existing projects only.
  - Write `project.json` after each mutating command.
- **Sources (D7).** Probe, then gate, then remap, using Task 1 and Task 2.
  - Check each source's path for existence after every change and emit `Missing`.
  - If the current source is removed: reload at the same index clamped to the new length, at 0.
  - If the current source is relinked: reload at the same source time.
  - Moves and removals of other sources change offsets only, with no reload.
  - While any source is missing, refuse to play or seek.
- **Harness tests** (`crates/pundit-harness/tests/`):
  - opening a folder with no project creates one;
  - opening a corrupt project refuses and keeps the previous project and folder;
  - restoring a folder that no longer exists doesn't create it;
  - an aspect mismatch is rejected;
  - a rotated source is rejected;
  - remove and move remap clips, match events and the current position;
  - a referenced source can't be removed;
  - a missing source blocks play.

  Use polling with timeouts, never sleeps.

Commit: `feat(app): bus with project lifecycle and source management`.

## Task 4b — Bus: transport, with harness tests

- **Skip.** `SkipCoordinator` over concat time, with `clip_duration = (total − 0.05).max(0.0)`, so its own clamp is the D8 clamp.
  - Each coordinator seek is `locate`d and issued with `Origin::Skip`.
  - `SeekDone { Skip }` calls `seek_completed()`.
  - `SeekDisplaced { Skip }` and `SeekFailed { Skip }` reset the coordinator.
- **Scrub.** `ScrubMove` issues KEY_UNIT seeks with `Origin::Scrub`. `ScrubRelease` resets the coordinator, then issues one ACCURATE seek clamped to `total − 0.05`.
- **Resets.** Reset the coordinator and clear the player slot on list mutation, open and `Error`. Never reset on a load that fulfils a skip.
- **EOS.**
  - On a non-final source: load the next source at 0 with `Origin::System`, and keep playing.
  - On the last source: `set_playing(false)` and emit `Playing(false)`.
- **Position.** Publish a new `source_index` before a load leaves READY. While a flight is busy, `target_abs` is set.
- **Volume.** `SetVolume` applies immediately and persists only when `commit` is set.
- **GL gate.** `GlReady` calls `player.set_gl_context`.
- **Harness tests:**
  - a skip burst across a source boundary lands on the accumulated target;
  - a skip burst followed by a scrub release never sticks, and the next skip works;
  - EOS advances to the next source and keeps playing;
  - EOS on the last source leaves the player paused;
  - a seek in the final second of a source stays in that source;
  - position is preserved when an earlier source is removed.

Commit: `feat(app): bus transport — skip, scrub, EOS advance`.

## Task 5 — Window with live video

This moves the spike into the app, so every later task can check its work by eye.

- **Startup.**
  - Select the backend as in D2.
  - Spawn the bus with `SinkKind::Gl`.
  - Open the project given as a command-line argument, if there is one (`cargo run -p pundit-app -- <folder>`); otherwise send `RestoreLastProject`.
- **Rendering notifier.**
  - `RenderingSetup`: assert EGL, wrap the context, send `GlReady { display, context }`.
  - `BeforeRendering`: take the mailbox buffer, wait on its `GLSyncMeta`, map it with `GLVideoFrame::from_buffer_readable`, **keep** it, and set the `Image` source.
  - `RenderingTeardown`: send `Shutdown` and wait for the ack.
- **Minimal UI.** A black player area with the video, and keys Space, Left/Right, A/D and Shift wired to the bus. The FocusScope comes in Task 6.
- **Manual check, with screenshots:**
  - play and pause;
  - a paused skip shows the new frame (preroll);
  - a cross-source skip in a two-source project;
  - the log shows the decoder, `memory:DMABuf` caps and EGL.

  Keep the spike example as a diagnostic (Task 0 decision); it isolates the zero-copy path from the app.

Commit: `feat(app): window with zero-copy video`.

### Task 5 notes (2026-09-19, reference laptop)

- **Shape.** `src/main.rs` selects the backend (D2), spawns the bus with `SinkKind::Gl`, and sends `OpenProject(<arg>)` or `RestoreLastProject`. Bus events reach the UI thread through `slint::Weak::upgrade_in_event_loop`. `src/video.rs` is the renderer bridge: `RenderingSetup` wraps the EGL context and sends `GlReady`, `BeforeRendering` takes the mailbox frame, waits on its `GLSyncMeta`, maps it and keeps it mapped until the next one, and `RenderingTeardown` calls `BusHandle::shutdown`. `ui/app.slint` holds the player area and a plain `FocusScope` `key-pressed` handler, which Task 6 replaces with the `capture-key-pressed` root scope. Slint and the EGL crates are now normal dependencies of `pundit-app`, because Cargo can't give a binary its own dependencies. The library doesn't use them, and `cargo test --workspace` passes with `DISPLAY` unset.
- **Manual check.** The test project had two sources, `20260314131843_000042.MP4` (HEVC 1920x1080 at 60 fps, 11.58 s) followed by `20260711105130_000010.MP4` (HEVC 2560x1440, 1242.17 s). Keys were sent to the window by id with python-xlib `XSendEvent`, since xdotool isn't installed.
  - Log for each load: `decoder Some("vah265dec")`, `glupload caps Some("video/x-raw(memory:DMABuf), format=(string)DMA_DRM, … drm-format=(string)NV12:0x0100000000000002")`, `GL platform Some("egl")`. Slint's context was `EGL`/`GLES2`.
  - Screenshots: a frame appears at startup; paused skips of +3 s show new preroll frames; play advances the picture; playback crosses from source 0 to source 1 by EOS advance (`loaded source 1`, position restarting at 0 and running at 1.0×); a paused state stays still (screenshot difference 0.0); a paused skip back (`Left`, then `a`) across the boundary shows source 0 again. Closing the window while playing exits with status 0. Launching with no argument restored the last project.
  - **Not exercised: Shift.** Synthetic key events don't carry modifier state into winit, which tracks modifiers through XKB, so the ±10 s path went untested.
- **Monitor off throttles playback.** With the laptop's monitor DPMS-off, playback crawled at about 0.1× in both the app and the Task 0 spike (26 `DirectDmabufExternal` uploads in 8 s). With `vblank_mode=0` it ran at 1.0× (221 uploads in 8 s). The likely cause is that the vsync-blocked swap on Slint's context also throttles GStreamer's GL work on the shared context. The mechanism wasn't confirmed. That's harmless with the screen on, but a UI thread that stalls in swap slows decoding.

## Task 6 — Sidebar, transport bar, dialogs, keyboard

- **Layout (D11).**
  - Sidebar:
    - project-name `LineEdit`, sending `RenameProject` on submit;
    - Sources list with duration and a missing marker, from `Missing`;
    - remove button, disabled with a tooltip when `source_is_referenced`;
    - drag-to-reorder via `DragArea`/`DropArea`, sending `MoveSource`.
  - Empty-state cards:
    - no project → Open…;
    - no sources → Add…;
    - a missing source → Relink…, for the first missing one.
  - Transport bar:
    - Open… and Add… (Add is disabled with no project);
    - play/pause, following `Playing`;
    - scrubber;
    - `current / total` readout;
    - volume slider.
  - One error dialog, with a message per `UserError`.
- **File pickers.** Use `rfd::AsyncFileDialog`, spawned with `slint::spawn_local` and parented to the window. Never use the blocking dialog on the event loop.
- **Readout and scrubber.**
  - A 30 Hz `Timer` computes concat time: `PositionHandle` plus the last `source_index`, or `target_abs` when it's set.
  - The timer drives both the readout and the scrubber, except while the scrubber is being dragged.
  - Format with an app-crate `format_hms`, matching macOS `formatDurationHMS`. Unit tests: 0, a negative value, NaN, 59.9, 3599.9, 3600.
- **Controls.**
  - Scrubber: moving it sends `ScrubMove`, releasing it sends `ScrubRelease`.
  - Volume: changes send `SetVolume { commit: false }`, release sends `commit: true`. The slider's initial value comes from the snapshot's `scan_volume`.
- **Keyboard (D10).**
  - A root `FocusScope` with `capture-key-pressed` handles every shortcut, and yields while the name `LineEdit` has focus.
  - Letters match case-insensitively. `Ctrl+O` opens.
- **Input hygiene.** Drop non-finite values before building a command (BACKLOG #28).

Commit: `feat(app): sidebar, transport bar, dialogs and keyboard`.

### Task 6 notes (2026-09-19, reference laptop)

- **Shape.** `ui/app.slint` holds the layout (D11): a 240 px sidebar (project-name `LineEdit`, Sources `ListView` whose rows are a `DropArea` around a `DragArea`, with a `×` remove button carrying a `Tooltip`), the player area with three mutually exclusive `EmptyCard`s, the transport bar, and a modal error overlay. One root `FocusScope` handles every shortcut in `capture-key-pressed` **and** swallows the same keys in `capture-key-released`: a Slint `Slider` fires `released` on an arrow key's *release*, which would otherwise have sent a `ScrubRelease` (and reset the skip burst) after every skip. Shortcuts yield while the name field has focus; `Return` in it renames and hands focus back. While the error dialog is up, every key is swallowed and `Return`/`Escape` dismiss it. Keys `1`/`2`/`3` and `Ctrl+0` are reserved: they call `zoom-reset`/`zoom-step`, which Task 7 wires.
- **Rust side.** `src/main.rs` turns callbacks into commands (dropping non-finite values) and applies events to a thread-local `UiState` (snapshot, missing flags, source index, target), because `upgrade_in_event_loop` closures must be `Send`. A 30 Hz `slint::Timer` sets the scrubber and the `current / total` readout from the scrubber itself while dragging, else `target_abs`, else `query_position` + the last source index (keeping the last value when the query fails). `src/pickers.rs` runs `rfd::AsyncFileDialog` (XDG portal) under `slint::spawn_local`, parented via Slint's `raw-window-handle-06` feature, one picker at a time. `format_hms` and `sentence` (capitalizes a `UserError`'s `Display` text for the dialog) live in the library's `format` module with unit tests. The source list shows durations with `format_hms`, so an hour-plus source reads `H:MM:SS` rather than the spec's `M:SS`. No bus change was needed.
- **Manual check.** Same two-source project as Task 5, `vblank_mode=0`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in the scratchpad, keys by `XSendEvent`. Focus was moved by a temporary hook (since removed), because synthetic pointer events don't reach winit (it reads XInput2; a sent `ButtonPress` did nothing).
  - Layout renders; the sidebar lists both sources with `0:11` and `20:42`; the readout reads `0:00 / 20:53` and advances while playing (0:03 → 0:06 → 0:08); the play button follows `Playing`.
  - **Scrubber focused** (proved by `End` reaching it: `ScrubRelease 1253.75`): `Right Right d` and `Left` each logged `Skip`, and no `ScrubRelease` followed their releases. **Volume focused** (proved by `Home`: volume 0, committed on key release, `scanVolume: 0.0` in `project.json`): `Right Right` skipped instead. Relaunching showed the volume slider at 0, from the snapshot.
  - **Name field focused:** `End x d space a Right Return` typed `xd a` into the name without any skip, `Return` saved it to `project.json`, and the next `Right` skipped.
  - Empty states: a folder without `project.json` shows "No source video added"; no project (fresh config) shows "No project open" with Add disabled; a project whose first source path is gone shows "Source video is missing: gone.MP4" with Relink…, the row marked Missing and Play disabled. A corrupt `project.json` shows the error dialog ("The project file is unreadable: …") over the no-project state; `Escape` dismissed it.
  - **Picker:** `Open Project…` (invoked by the hook while playing) showed the portal's "Open Project Folder" chooser, `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR` the app window and modal; the readout and picture kept advancing behind it; `Escape` cancelled it.
  - Cross-source: skipping past 11.58 s loaded source 1 and the readout continued in concat time.
  - **Not verified:** drag-to-reorder, clicking buttons and dragging sliders with a real pointer, the tooltip, Shift ±10 s and `Ctrl+O` (synthetic events carry no modifier state), and choosing a file in a picker. Task 8's manual pass covers them.

## Task 7 — Zoom

D9. Zoom state lives in the UI and isn't persisted.

- **Geometry.**
  - The frame's display size comes from the mailbox `VideoInfo`, including PAR.
  - The content rect is `Zoom::IDENTITY.transform(...)`.
  - The `Image`'s geometry comes from `zoom.transform(...)` inside `clip: true`.
  - The cursor is mapped through `Zoom::content_fraction` (Task 1).
- **Input.**
  - Ctrl+scroll: `scale × 1.1^(dy/60)` about the cursor.
  - Plain scroll: pan by `delta / (content size × scale)`; a no-op at 1×.
  - Primary-button drag: pans when scale > 1, after a 4 px threshold.
  - Keys `1`, `2`, `3` and `Ctrl+0`.
  - Always `clamped()`. No snapping, no throttle.
- **Reset.** Return to identity on `ProjectOpened`.
- **Indicator.** Use the D9 constants.
- **Manual check.** Ctrl+scroll and two-finger pan on the touchpad, and zoom while paused.
- **Pixel snapping** (Task 0 finding). Skia rounds a translate-only image position to whole physical pixels, while width scales continuously. Judge by eye whether a slow pan steps visibly. If it does, try giving the `Image` a non-translate transform (for example `transform-scale`) so Skia stops snapping. Record the outcome.

Commit: `feat(app): zoom and pan`.

### Task 7 notes (2026-09-19, reference laptop)

- **Shape.** The zoom lives in `main.rs`'s `UiState` (reset to identity on `ProjectOpened`) and is mirrored to the window as a `ZoomState` for drawing. The input math is in the library's `zoom_input` module, unit-tested without a display: `Viewport` (frame display size + player area; `None` when anything is empty or non-finite), `picture` (`Zoom::transform`'s rect), `panned`, `scrolled`, `stepped` and `DragPan` (4 px threshold, then the whole distance from the press so the grabbed point stays under the pointer). `video.rs` now sets `frame-width`/`frame-height` (display width via PAR) instead of `frame-aspect`. The player `Rectangle` is `clip: true`; its `picture` binding calls a `pure callback place-picture(zoom, frame, area)`, so it re-evaluates by itself on a zoom, resize or frame-shape change. A `TouchArea` under the empty-state cards (enabled only with `can-play`) sends scroll, primary press and drag; keys `2`/`3` pass the TouchArea's `has-hover` and pointer. The indicator (`ZoomIndicator` in `app.slint`) takes its ticks from `SNAP_NOTCHES`.
- **Signs.** winit's scroll delta is positive when "content should move right/down"; Slint multiplies line deltas by 60 and its `Flickable` moves content by `+delta`. So a scroll moves the picture by `+delta` (as a document scrolls; natural scrolling is applied by the system first), a drag moves it by the pointer's delta, Shift+scroll swaps axes as `Flickable` does, and Ctrl+scroll with `dy > 0` (wheel away) zooms in.
- **Keys `2`/`3` with the pointer outside the player** zoom about the picture's centre. macOS clamped an outside cursor to the view's edge, which just picks an arbitrary edge.
- **Zoomed picture spills into the letterbox bars.** The clip is the player area and the pan limit is core's, relative to the content rect. So at 1.5× on a 16:9 picture in an 860×652 area, the picture covers the bars, and at the pan limit the source edge sits at the content-rect edge with a black band beyond it. That's coherent and uses the space; clipping to the content rect instead would match macOS's aspect-locked view.
- **Pixel snapping: fixed.** A 2× zoom was panned programmatically in 0.25 px steps, paused, and consecutive window screenshots were compared (mean absolute luma over the picture). With the `Image` sized to the rect, the picture changed only every 4th step (3.58, the rest 0.000): 1 px steps. Drawing the `Image` at its 1× size at `(tx, ty)` with `transform-origin: {0, 0}` and `transform-scale: zoom.scale` (the same rect, no distortion) put a scale in Skia's matrix, so `pixel_align_origin_auto_restore` no longer applies: every 0.25 px step changed the picture by 0.97, about a quarter of a 1 px step. That's what shipped. At 1× the transform is translate-only and still snaps, but nothing pans there.
- **Manual check** (same two-source project, `vblank_mode=0`, keys by `XSendEvent`; scroll, drag and Ctrl can't be synthesized, so a temporary `T7_CMD` hook, since removed, invoked the same callbacks). 1× shows no indicator; `3` `3` gave 1.50× about the real pointer (which winit did see hover over the player; the logged pan matched `zoomed_to_cursor` at its position), with the indicator at the 1.5 notch; `2` gave 1.25×; `1` returned a picture identical to the 1× one (difference 0.000) and the indicator faded out over about 0.15 s. All of that while paused: the picture updates without playing. Ctrl+scroll up (`dy` 60, then 300) about the EXIT sign zoomed to 1.77× with the sign fixed under the pointer; `dy` −1000 returned to identity. Plain scroll at 1× did nothing; at 2× `dx` 20 and `dy` 40 moved pan by exactly `delta / (content × scale)`; Shift swapped axes. A drag of 2.8 px did nothing, 5 px panned by the full 5 px, then each step. Zoom held while playing and zooming during playback worked.
- **Not verified:** real scroll, touchpad and drag input through the `TouchArea` (so the delta signs are verified by reading Slint and winit, not by hand), Ctrl+0, and the reset on opening another project. Task 8's manual pass covers them.

## Task 8 — Closeout

- **Manual checklist** on the reference laptop: every "Done when" item, plus arrows after touching each slider, and the boundary hold during multi-source playback (spec Risk 4). Record the results in this plan. Screenshots stay in the scratchpad, not the repo.
- **Gate script.** `scripts/linux-gate-check.sh` still passes on the camera footage.
- **Wayland** (Risk 2). Check it if a Wayland session is available; otherwise record that it wasn't checked.
- **BACKLOG #30.** Tune `DEFAULT_BURST_WINDOW` by feel, and record the result.
- **`CLAUDE.md`.** Document how to run the app and that it needs the Skia renderer.
- **Review.** Adversarial review of the shipped code (`adversarial-review` skill), then apply, `verify` and commit.
- **Spike removed (review, 2026-09-19).** `examples/zero_copy_spike.rs` was deleted after all, reversing Task 0's "stays as a diagnostic": the app logs the same decoder / `glupload` caps / GL platform on every load, and `scripts/linux-gate-check.sh` covers measurement, so the spike was a second copy of the GL path to keep compiling for nothing.

## Deliberately not in this phase

- Clips, tags and undo (Phase 3).
- Capture (Phase 4).
- Export (Phases 5 and 8).
- Drawing (Phase 6).
- Preview (Phase 7).
- Scoreboard (Phase 9).
- Transcription (Phase 10).
- The spec's Deferred list.

**Orchestrator follow-up to Task 7:** the zoomed picture is now clipped to the letterboxed content rect instead of the whole player area. Before, it spilled into the letterbox bars and showed black only at the pan limit. What's on screen now matches exactly the crop export produces, and it's the same rect Phase 6 strokes normalize to. Confirmed by screenshot at 1.75×: the bars stay black and the picture stops at the content edges.

**Task 8 closeout status (orchestrator):**
- Gate script re-run on the camera footage: PASS. Zero-copy under EGL; KEY_UNIT 2.6 / 55.1 ms, ACCURATE 8.6 / 21.1 ms (median / worst).
- `CLAUDE.md` now documents how to run the app.
- Adversarial code review is done (simplification + correctness). Both fix passes are applied: the pause-then-seek early-completion race (reproduced 10/10, now fixed and pinned by a test), saves no longer recreating folders, error recovery, derived seek state, and the other fixes.
- Wayland was **not checked**: the reference laptop runs an X11 session only.
- **Waiting on the user** (needs a real pointer or modifier keys, which synthetic input can't provide): drag-to-reorder, Shift±10 s, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+0, live scrubber drag, touchpad two-finger pan and Ctrl+scroll zoom, click-drag pan, picking files in the dialogs, the burst-window feel (BACKLOG #30), and the boundary hold (Risk 4).
