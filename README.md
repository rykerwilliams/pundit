# pundit

*pundit Understands Nothing, Discusses It Thoroughly.*

A desktop app for breaking down game film, for Linux. Open the game video,
record your commentary over it with a webcam and microphone while you play,
pause, scrub, zoom and draw on the picture, and export each clip as a video
with your voice, your drawings and a picture-in-picture of you burned in.

## What it does

- **Commentary clips.** Each clip is a recording of you talking over the game
  video: the webcam and microphone, plus everything you did to the picture
  while recording — play, pause, seek, zoom and pan, and freehand drawings. It
  all replays in step, in the preview and in the export.
- **Clips you can find again.** Name them, tag them, add notes, and filter the
  clip list by tag. Undo and redo with Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z.
- **Scoreboard and match clock.** Set up the two teams, their colours and the
  match format, then tag goals and the start and end of each period (Z, X and
  V). The clock and score are drawn into previews and exports. If your video
  starts after kick-off, the clock can still read correctly.
- **Transcripts.** Transcribe a clip's commentary on your own computer, with
  [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp).
- **Export.** One H.264 `.mp4` per target — every clip, the clips with one tag,
  or a single clip — at 720p or 1080p, into the project's `exports/` folder.
  Each clip carries a caption bar with its number, name and tags, and the
  webcam inset can be turned off per clip.

A project is a folder: `project.json`, your commentary in `recordings/`, and
your exports in `exports/`. The game video stays where it is.

## Install

pundit ships as a `.deb` for **Ubuntu 24.04 and Linux Mint 22** on
x86-64. Download it from the
[releases page](https://github.com/rykerwilliams/pundit/releases), then,
in the folder you downloaded it to:

```bash
sudo apt install ./pundit_*_amd64.deb
```

If you have **Coach Cuts** installed — the name this app went by until 0.8.0 —
that one command replaces it, and your settings, your basket and the speech
model you already downloaded are carried over on the first run.

Or [build the package yourself](#build-from-source), which is also how you get
a build newer than the last release.

It appears in the applications menu as **pundit**. From a terminal it is
`pundit`, or `pundit <folder>` to open (or create) a project there;
with no argument it reopens the last project.

### Requirements

- **GStreamer 1.24 or newer**, as Ubuntu 24.04 ships it. The package pulls in
  the plugin sets it needs.
- **An x86-64-v3 CPU** — Haswell (2013) or newer, with AVX2, FMA, F16C and
  BMI2. The speech recognizer is built for that instruction set.
- **A VA-API driver for hardware video decode and encode.** The package
  recommends `intel-media-va-driver` (or `va-driver-all`), and apt installs
  it by default. Without one, playback falls back to software decode, and
  recording and export to the `x264enc` software encoder, which is much
  slower.
- **An OpenGL (EGL) capable display**, X11 or Wayland.
- **A webcam and microphone** for recording: the camera is captured through
  V4L2 and the microphone through PipeWire.

### Transcription and the network

Transcription runs entirely on your computer. The first time you transcribe,
the app downloads the speech model you chose in the clip inspector —
`small.en` (488 MB, the default, more accurate) or `base.en` (148 MB, faster)
— into `~/.cache/pundit/models/`, and keeps it. The Transcribe button
names the download before you press it. After that, nothing leaves your
machine.

### When something goes wrong

The app writes its diagnostics to stderr. Started from the applications menu
on an X11 session (Linux Mint's default), that lands in `~/.xsession-errors`;
or start it from a terminal as `pundit` to see it directly.

## Build from source

On Ubuntu 24.04 / Linux Mint 22, with Rust 1.92 or newer from
[rustup](https://rustup.rs), install the packages listed (and explained) in
[`packaging/build-deps.txt`](packaging/build-deps.txt) — the same list CI
installs:

```bash
sudo apt install $(grep -o '^[^#]*' packaging/build-deps.txt)

cargo run --release -p pundit-app   # run it
cargo test --workspace              # test it
```

The first build compiles whisper.cpp and takes a few minutes.

To build the `.deb` (into `target/debian/`), also install `cargo-deb` and
`cargo-about`, then run the packaging script:

```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-deb
cargo install --locked cargo-about --features cli
packaging/build-deb.sh
```

The code is a Cargo workspace under `crates/`: `pundit-core` (pure logic,
no media dependencies), `pundit-media` (GStreamer), `pundit-app` (the
Slint UI) and `pundit-harness` (headless integration tests). The
developer conventions — the zero-copy decode path, the capture clock, the
export graph, how to run CI's GPU-less path locally — are in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md), and the design is in
[`docs/superpowers/specs/`](docs/superpowers/specs/).

## Where this came from

This began as a macOS app written in Swift, SwiftUI and AVFoundation, forked
from [tayl0r/coach-cutups](https://github.com/tayl0r/coach-cutups) — whose
author named it **Coach Cuts**, which is what this app was called up to 0.7.0.
The Linux rewrite was written against that Swift tree, which lived here under
`apple/`; it is no longer in the working tree and is kept whole at the tag
`macos-reference` (`git worktree add /tmp/macos-reference macos-reference`).
Linux is the only platform maintained here, and the name changed at 0.8.0
because the app is not football-only and should not carry one it inherited.

## Licence

AGPL-3.0-or-later — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). The package installs the
licence notices for the third-party code built into the binary under
`/usr/share/doc/pundit/`.
