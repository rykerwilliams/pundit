# Build the pundit .deb: target/debian/pundit_<version>_amd64.deb.
#
#   packaging/build-deb.sh [extra cargo-deb flags]
#
# Needs cargo-deb and cargo-about (`cargo install cargo-deb` and
# `cargo install cargo-about --features cli`), and dpkg-dev, whose
# dpkg-shlibdeps computes the linked-library half of Depends. Without it
# cargo-deb only warns and ships no libc floor; packaging/smoke-test.sh fails
# such a package.
#
# First the crate licence notices (spec S6), generated from Cargo.lock by
# cargo-about. Its accepted-licence list (packaging/about.toml) is also the
# GPL-2.0-only tripwire, so a crate whose licence isn't on it fails here,
# before the three-minute build. Then cargo-deb, which ships the notices from
# the path the asset list names.
#
# Last, whisper.cpp's instruction set is asserted on the release build that
# was packaged. `.cargo/config.toml` pins it, but cargo does not rerun
# whisper-rs-sys's build script when that [env] changes, so a warm target/
# can still hold a library built before the pin: `-march=native` dies with
# SIGILL on an older CPU, and one without `-mavx2` is scalar and unusably
# slow.
