# Needs docker. A clean container, not the build machine, because the build
# machine already has every library installed and so can't prove the package's
# dependency list (Phase 11 spec, Done-when #1). The steps:
#
#   1. Depends carries `libc6 (>= 2.39)`: proof that dpkg-shlibdeps ran.
#   2. `apt install` of the package alone (no Recommends) resolves.
#   3. Every software-path GStreamer element the code names exists.
#   4. The app launches under Xvfb, stays up, and creates a project. This is
#      the only proof of the X11 libraries winit dlopens, which no linker or
#      dpkg-shlibdeps sees. It decodes nothing: hardware decode is checked by
#      hand on the laptop.
